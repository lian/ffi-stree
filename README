# FFI::Stree

This library provides a wrapper for the 'generic suffix tree library' (libstree) using FFI.

    libstree is a generic suffix tree implementation, written in C.
    It can handle arbitrary data structures as elements of a string.
    Unlike most demo implementations, it is not limited to simple
    ASCII character strings. Suffix tree generation in libstree is
    highly efficient and implemented using the algorithm by Ukkonen.
